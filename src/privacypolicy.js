The Categories of Personal Information We Collect

“Personal information” means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular individual or household.

A. Senders and Recipients

Identifiers, for example, name, email address, phone number(s), and profile photo.
Commercial information, for example, records of Delivery Services provided and received, saved addresses, information about your use of the OMW Platform, our Services and the Delivery Services, including pick-up and drop-off information, details regarding the goods sent and received, date, time, destination, distance, route, payment, and whether you used a promotional or referral code.
Internet activity information, for example, information about your usage of the Platform and our Services, such as the pages you viewed on the Website or App, the services and features you used or interacted with; your browser type and details about any links or communications with which you interacted; internet protocol (IP); browser plug-in types and versions; and operating systems and platform.
Geolocation information, for example, for pick-up and delivery addresses.
Financial information, for example, payment card and bank account details and billing address.
Communications data, for example, during our communications with you we collect the content of these communications as well as metadata about the communications, e., date and time of the call or text (SMS or MMS) message and phone numbers; when you post questions or reviews, or contribute to our blogs or on OMW community forums or social media pages we collect the information that you provide, including the contents of messages or attachments you send us; and when you rate and provide feedback about other Users, Recipients, our Platform and Services, or the Delivery Services we collect all the information you provide.
OMW referral programs, for example, if you participate in any OMW referral program, such as recommending our Services, we will ask you for certain information about your referral, including their name and email address or phone number. We store and use this information for the sole purpose of contacting the referral about our Services and tracking the success of our referral programs.
Inferences, for example, we may draw inferences about you from other personal information we collect, such as inferring based on the Delivery Services you request, or which of our Services you use, that you may be interested in similar services.
We collect financial information necessary to facilitate transactions related to our services. However, it's important to note that our access to this information is limited. We do not have complete access to your financial details. This means that while we gather certain information to process payments and provide our services, sensitive financial details, such as full credit card numbers, are not fully accessible to us. This limited access is a part of our commitment to maintaining the security and privacy of your financial information.

B. Drivers

Identifiers, for example, name, email address, mobile number, date of birth, profile photo, driver’s license, 
Commercial information, for example, information about your use of the OMW Platform, our Services and the Delivery Services provided by you, including pick-up and drop-off information, details regarding the goods you delivered, date, time, destination, distance, route, payment, and whether you used a promotional or referral code.
Internet activity information, for example, information about your usage of the Platform and our Services, such as the pages you viewed on the Website or App, the services and features you used or interacted with; your browser type and details about any links or communications with which you interacted; internet protocol (IP); browser plug-in types and versions; and operating systems and platform.
We collect financial information necessary to facilitate transactions related to our services. However, it's important to note that our access to this information is limited. We do not have complete access to your financial details. This means that while we gather certain information to process payments and provide our services, sensitive financial details, such as full credit card numbers, are not fully accessible to us. This limited access is a part of our commitment to maintaining the security and privacy of your financial information.
Biometric information, for example, identifiers such as a selfie, scan of your driver’s license and/or other government ID or photo, that OMW may collect from you so that you may be eligible to perform certain Delivery Services and to help protect against theft and fraud.
Geo-location information, for example your device will share your GPS coordinates when the OMW App is open (active location information) in order to track pick-ups and deliveries, and when the OMW App is not open, but your mobile device is turned on (heartbeat location information) in order to notify you of delivery opportunities at or near your current location.
Communications data, for example, during our communications with you we collect the content of these communications as well as metadata about the communications, e., date and time of the call or text (SMS or MMS) message and phone numbers; when you post questions or reviews, or contribute to our blogs or on OMW’s community forums or social media pages we collect the information that you provide, including the contents of messages or attachments you send us; and when you rate and provide feedback about other Users, Recipients, our Platform and Services, or the Delivery Services we collect all the information you provide.
Inferences, for example, we may draw inferences about you from other personal information we collect such as inferring based on your offer to provide particular Delivery Services, that you may be interested in offering to perform similar types of Delivery Services in similar locations.
Note on Sensitive Personal Information: OMW does not infer characteristics from sensitive personal information.  OMW only uses such sensitive personal information as necessary to perform the services the average person would reasonably expect when requesting, performing and/or receiving those services, to ensure security and integrity, short term transient use, to maintain the quality of our products and services, or for other purposes permitted by the California Privacy Rights Act and implementing regulations (“CPRA”) without the right to opt out.

C. Cookies, Analytics and Third Party Technologies

We and our third-party service providers use a variety of technologies that passively and automatically collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with our Platform or Services, including the technologies listed below:

Cookies. A cookie is a data file placed on your computer or mobile device when it is used to access our Platform and Services. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our Website and web pages.

Web Beacons. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier (“1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”), similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. Web beacons allow us to understand how Users navigate our Platform and Services and what content is effective, which allows us to manage and improve our Platform and Services. We also use web beacon technologies to count Users of our Platform and Services, how many of the emails we send were opened and how many particular articles or links on our pages were actually viewed.

Embedded Scripts. Embedded Scripts are programming code and collect information about your exchanges and communications with our Platform and Services and the Delivery Services. They are temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server (or from a third party service provider) and are active only while you are connected to our Platform or using our Services or performing Delivery Services and the code is deactivated and/or deleted after.

How We May Disclose Your Personal Information.

We do not sell your personal information or disclose it to third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising. We also do not sell the personal information of children under 16 nor disclose it to third parties for cross-context behavioral advertising.

To deliver our Services and to allow you to request, provide or receive Delivery Services, we may disclose your personal information with other Users, Recipients, other third parties, and service providers in the following ways:

User Content. Your account profile and information that you post or share, such as photos, reviews, comments, suggestions, questions about our Services or Delivery Services, information about you or your experience, posts or comments on OMW’s blogs, community forums and social media pages (collectively “User Content”), may be seen and disclosed with other Users of our Platform, our Services, the Delivery Services, Recipients or the public. You should therefore think carefully before deciding what information you share.

Information Shared Between Users. If you are a Sender, we provide some of your personal information, such as your first name, photo, phone number, details about the goods you send, pick-up and delivery addresses to the Driver who offers on and/or is accepted to perform your Delivery Services, so that the Driver may contact you, and to facilitate pick-up and delivery. If you are a Driver, we provide some of your personal information, such as your first name, photo, phone number, geolocation and tracking information to the Sender and Recipient so that the Sender and/or Recipient can track their delivery.

Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf. OMW uses third party vendors to assist in operating our Platform and providing our Services and the Delivery Services. We may provide these vendors with access to the following categories of personal information (as we have done for the past 12 months):

Personal identifiers, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, date of birth, government identification number (such as social security number), driver’s license information and scans of your driver’s license and/or other government ID photo.

Biometric information or identifiers, such as a selfie, scan of your driver’s license and/or other government ID or photo, scan of your face, facial patterns, fingerprints, and voice or typing cadence (“biometric data”).

Transaction information, such as information about the Delivery Services, Driver, Sender and Recipient statistics and feedback, and Driver and Sender transaction history.
Internet or other electronic network activity information, such as IP address, type of browser, version of operating system, carrier and/or manufacturer, device identifiers, and mobile advertising identifiers.
We may disclose the above categories of personal information to third party vendors for the following business purposes: to verify your identity; to design and/or operate our Platform and Services; track our Services’ and the Delivery Services analytics; process payments; assist in anti-fraud and security measures; help us provide customer support and geo-location information to our Users and Recipients; to provide advertising services; to provide administrative services such as communication, technical and maintenance services, database management, web analytics, and other administrative services.

Co-Branded Services. At times, some of our Services and/or the Delivery Services may be provided to you in association with third parties including charities and sponsors (“Co-Branded Services”) and your use of these Co-Branded Services may require you or us to disclose certain of your information to the third party, for instance to confirm your goods have been delivered as requested.  Any Co-Branded Services offered to you will specifically identify the third party. Any information that you disclose directly to a third party will be subject to that party’s posted privacy policy.

Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions. From time to time OMW may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (each, a “Promotion”) that require registration. Each Promotion may contain specific rules and requirements, which will be disclosed to you at the time of sign-up. If you choose to enter a Promotion, your information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion’s official rules, such as on a winners list.

Legal Reasons. We may access, use, preserve, transfer and disclose your personal information to government, law enforcement officials and/or private parties as we reasonably determine to be necessary and appropriate to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, subpoenas, governmental requests or legal or regulatory process, or reporting obligations; to protect the safety, rights, property or security of OMW, our Platform and Services, the Delivery Services or any third party, including you; to protect the safety of the public; to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; and/or to prevent or stop activity we reasonably consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, an illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity.

How Long We Keep Your Personal Information.

Users

Generally.  OMW will retain your personal information as long as you maintain a User account, or for the duration of our relationship, if any.  Excluding biometric data, OMW also retains User personal information for at least three (3) years after our last interaction with you to maintain compliance with our contractual obligations with our Users and with reporting and other regulatory and legal requirements and applicable law; to conduct re-engagement and marketing campaigns and otherwise communicate with you about our Platform and Services; to maintain and confirm your opt-in and opt-out preferences; to resolve disputes, investigate or prevent fraud and other inappropriate activity; to enforce our agreements, and for other business purposes as set forth herein. 

Biometric Data. If you are a Driver, OMW and our vendors will retain any of your biometric data collected for only as long as is needed for the Delivery Services you provide, or for three (3) years after the date of your last interaction with us, whichever is earlier.  At the completion of the retention period, we destroy your biometric data by permanently deleting all such biometric data from our servers. 

For the processing of financial transactions, we utilize Stripe, a third-party payment processing service. As such, any financial information you provide is also subject to Stripe’s privacy policy. We encourage you to review Stripe's privacy policy to understand how your financial information is handled by them. Stripe operates independently of our services, and their handling of your financial information is governed by their own privacy and security policies.

Recipients

OMW retains personal information of Recipients provided to it by a Sender in accordance with our contractual obligations with the Sender.  All such information is stored and used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Text Messages. You can opt out of text messages by contacting support@itsomw.com, changing your account settings, or replying STOP from the mobile device that received the message.

Push Notifications. You can opt out of receiving push notifications through your device settings.

Location Information. To ensure the safe delivery of goods using our Platform, and to provide Senders with our Services and the Delivery Services, OMW’s Terms and Conditions require Drivers to keep their device sharing geolocation information while actively performing Delivery Services. Drivers can otherwise prevent their device from sharing geolocation information through your device’s system settings.  Note that preventing your device from sharing your location information will not allow OMW to notify you of delivery opportunities and may otherwise impact OMW’s ability to provide you with our full range of features and services.

Cookies. You can modify your cookie settings on your browser, but if you delete or choose not to accept our cookies, you may be missing out on certain features of our Services and Platform.

After a period of time, your data may be anonymized and aggregated, and then may be held by us as long as necessary for us to provide our Platform and Services, and the Delivery Services effectively.

Call 844-4OMW (1-844-476-2343).
How We Will Verify Your Request

The processes that we follow to verify your identity when you make a request to know, correct, or delete are described below.  The relevant process depends on how and why the request is submitted.

If you submit a request by any means other than through a password-protected account that you created before the date of your request, the verification process that we follow will depend on the nature of your request.

For a less risky request, such as a request to know how we handle your personal information, we will match at least two data points that you provide against information about you that we already have in our records and that we have determined to be reliable for purposes of verifying your identity.  Examples of relevant data points include your mobile phone number, your zip code, or information about products or services that you have purchased from us.

For a more risky request, such as a request for a copy of specific pieces of your personal information, we will match at least three data points that you provide against information that we already have about you in our records and that we have determined to be reliable for purposes of verifying your identity. In addition, we may require you to sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the individual whose personal information is the subject of the request.

We have implemented the following additional procedures when verifying the identity of requestors:

If we cannot verify your identity based on the processes described above, we may ask you for additional verification information. If we do so, we will not use that information for any purpose other than verification.
If we cannot verify your identity to a sufficient level of certainty to respond to your request, we will let you know promptly and explain why we cannot verify your identity. 
Authorized Agents. If an authorized agent submits a request to know, correct, or delete on your behalf, the authorized agent must submit with the request either (a) a power of attorney that is valid under California law, or (b) document signed by you that authorizes the authorized agent to submit the request on your behalf.  In addition, we may ask you to follow the applicable process described above for verifying your identity.  You can obtain an “Authorized Agent Designation” form by contacting us at support@itsomw.com.

Company’s Non-Discrimination Policy. You have the right not to be discriminated against if you exercise your California privacy rights.

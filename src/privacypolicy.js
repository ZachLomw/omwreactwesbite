        If you are a Driver, we provide some of your personal information, such as your first name, photo, phone number,
        geolocation and tracking information to the Sender and Recipient so that the Sender and/or Recipient can track
        their delivery.

      <h3>Third Parties Providing Services on Our Behalf.</h3>
      <p>
        OMW uses third party vendors to assist in operating our Platform and providing our Services and the Delivery

      </ul>

      <p>

      <p>
        At times, some of our Services and/or the Delivery Services may be provided to you in association with third
        parties including charities and sponsors ("Co-Branded Services") and your use of these Co-Branded Services may
        require you or us to disclose certain of your information to the third party, for instance to confirm your goods
        have been delivered as requested. Any Co-Branded Services offered to you will specifically identify the third
        party. Any information that you disclose directly to a third party will be subject to that party's posted privacy
        policy.

        relationship, if any. Excluding biometric data, OMW also retains User personal information for at least three (3)
        years after our last interaction with you to maintain compliance with our contractual obligations with our Users

        needed for the Delivery Services you provide, or for three (3) years after the date of your last interaction with
        us, whichever is earlier. At the completion of the retention period, we destroy your biometric data by
        permanently deleting all such biometric data from our servers.

      <p>
        You have the right to submit a verifiable request that OMW delete personal information that you have provided to
        us. Note that deletion requests are subject to certain limitations, for example, we may keep information as
        required or permitted by law and/or our contractual obligations. We may also keep transaction history and
        information needed to process future transactions, certain account-related information (as noted above in Closing
        Your Account), and to facilitate User requests.

        You have the right to submit a verifiable request for the correction of inaccurate personal information
        maintained by OMW, taking into account the nature of the personal information and the purposes for processing the
        personal information.
      </p>

      <h4>Submitting a Request.</h4>
      <p>
        California residents can submit a request to know, delete, and correct in accordance with applicable law in one
        of the following ways:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          By emailing us at support@itsomw.com. Please include your full name, email address, and the phone number
          associated with your OMW account, along with the type of request you are making, so that we can process your

      </ul>

      <h4>How We Will Verify Your Request</h4>
      <p>
        The processes that we follow to verify your identity when you make a request to know, correct, or delete are
        described below. The relevant process depends on how and why the request is submitted.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you submit a request by any means other than through a password-protected account that you created before the
        date of your request, the verification process that we follow will depend on the nature of your request.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          For a less risky request, such as a request to know how we handle your personal information, we will match at
          least two data points that you provide against information about you that we already have in our records and
          that we have determined to be reliable for purposes of verifying your identity. Examples of relevant data
          points include your mobile phone number, your zip code, or information about products or services that you have
          purchased from us.
        </li>
        <li>
          For a more risky request, such as a request for a copy of specific pieces of your personal information, we will
          match at least three data points that you provide against information that we already have about you in our
          records and that we have determined to be reliable for purposes of verifying your identity. In addition, we may
          require you to sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the individual whose personal
          information is the subject of the request.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>We have implemented the following additional procedures when verifying the identity of requestors:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          If we cannot verify your identity based on the processes described above, we may ask you for additional
          verification information. If we do so, we will not use that information for any purpose other than
          verification.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we cannot verify your identity to a sufficient level of certainty to respond to your request, we will let you know promptly and explain why we cannot verify your identity.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Authorized Agents.</h4>
  <p>
    If an authorized agent submits a request to know, correct, or delete on your behalf, the authorized agent must
    submit with the request either (a) a power of attorney that is valid under California law, or (b) document signed
    by you that authorizes the authorized agent to submit the request on your behalf. In addition, we may ask you to
    follow the applicable process described above for verifying your identity. You can obtain an "Authorized Agent
    Designation" form by contacting us at support@itsomw.com.
  </p>

  <h4>Company's Non-Discrimination Policy.</h4>
  <p>
    You have the right not to be discriminated against if you exercise your California privacy rights.
